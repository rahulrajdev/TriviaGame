# TriviaGame
I have created a 10 question, timed Trivia Game using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. The game is set up as an object with each question as a sub-object. Each question has various properties/methods that are accessed according to what elements on the page need to be populated. In addition, I keep track of the number of the user's correct answers, incorrect and unaswered questions and display them to the final screen. 

Finally, the main purpose of the project was to emphasize and master the use of jQuery timers. I have implemented two timers here, one for a 20 second stopwatch interval and a 5 second timeout for when the next question appears. 

Hope you know your NBA trivia! 

Please reach out if you have any questions! :)
